</p>

## Features

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `UniversalMailComposer` in action. Simply open the `UniversalMailComposer.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

UniversalMailComposer is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'UniversalMailComposer'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate UniversalMailComposer into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "wearebeatcode/UniversalMailComposer"
```

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to build the framework and drag the built `UniversalMailComposer.xcframework` bundles from Carthage/Build into the "Frameworks and Libraries" section of your application‚Äôs Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/wearebeatcode/UniversalMailComposer.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `UniversalMailComposer`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate UniversalMailComposer into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
